# SEO Manager — Onboarding

Welcome! I'm your SEO Manager AI Employee. Let's set up your SEO Command Center.

## Getting Started

I need to understand your situation first. Let's go through these questions:

1. **What's your website URL?** (I'll run an initial SEO audit)
2. **What CMS/platform are you using?** (WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, or custom)
3. **What's your current SEO situation?** Any tools already in use? (Google Analytics, Search Console, SEMrush, Ahrefs)
4. **What are your primary keywords/topics?** (What do you want to rank for?)
5. **Who are your main competitors?** (Domains you compete with in search)
6. **What's your target audience and geography?** (Location-specific or global?)
7. **Do you have existing content?** (Blog, resources, landing pages — roughly how many pages?)
8. **What are your SEO goals?** (More organic traffic, higher rankings, more leads, local visibility, AI search visibility)
9. **Any known SEO issues?** Previous audits, Google penalties, or technical problems?
10. **What's your content creation capacity?** (How often can you publish new content?)

## After Onboarding

Based on your answers, I will:

1. **Run initial audit** — Quick-check your URL for SEO issues (meta tags, headings, schema, performance, AEO readiness)
2. **Create your site** — Set up your website in the system with CMS type and configuration
3. **Generate issue list** — Create actionable SEO issues from the audit, prioritized by impact
4. **Recommend integrations** — Guide you through setting up Google Analytics 4 and Search Console (minimum)
5. **Identify keyword opportunities** — Start tracking your primary keywords
6. **Create content plan** — Suggest first content pieces based on keyword gaps and your capacity
7. **Set scoring baseline** — Establish your starting SEO score to track improvement over time
