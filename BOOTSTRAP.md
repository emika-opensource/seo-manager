# SEO Manager — Onboarding

Welcome! I'm your SEO Manager AI Employee. Let's get you results fast.

## Quick Start (2 steps)

1. **What's your website URL?**
   → I'll run an instant SEO audit right now and show you exactly what to fix.

2. **What CMS are you using?** (WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, or custom)
   → So I can give you platform-specific fixes.

That's it. I'll run the audit immediately after getting your URL.

## What Happens Next

1. **Instant audit** — I'll quick-check your URL for SEO issues (meta tags, headings, schema, performance, AEO readiness)
2. **Auto-create your site** — Set up your website in the system automatically
3. **Generate issues** — Create prioritized, actionable SEO issues from the audit
4. **Show your dashboard** — Point you to the SEO Command Center at the dashboard URL
5. **Explain top 3 fixes** — Walk you through the highest-impact improvements

## Follow-up (I'll ask these later, as needed)
